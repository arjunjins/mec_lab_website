KEYWORD 

Our project is a web application that helps the user to learn touch typing ( a method where one types without looking into the keyboard, ie by using one’s muscle memory ). 

What makes our application unique is that there are no boring repetitive exercises. Unlike most other typing tutors, this application does not force you to repeat the same lessons like ‘jjf jjk jjf jjk’ over and over again. This is very annoying and contributes very little to your overall learning.
Instead our algorithm produces a set of words which obey phonetic rules so they sound natural and the user can easily read the words. ( Note : the words produced may or may not be real words with proper meaning )

By modelling the real world, the user gets an extra edge over others, for example, some set of repetitive words like “-tion” will be coming countless times in the words we produce so that the user learns how to type a set of combination of words also in addition to studying ’t’ ‘i’ ‘o’ ’n’ individually. This method contributes to muscle memory way faster and saves time when compared to ordinary typing tutor.

First a set of most common letters are chosen and words are produced based on this subset. After the user is comfortable in typing all the letters in the previous subset, the next most used word is added to the existing subset of words till the user learns every alphabet. Even after learning all the letters the user can still practice to improve their speed

Additional services include :
Goal setting : User can set goals and deadlines 
Multiplayer : Area where you can flex your typing speed and compete with friends
Choose your text : Type in your homework/things you want to learn like a blog on python and study simultaneously!
Osu : For all the anime fans out there, listen and type to the beat of your favourite music
